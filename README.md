## Step 3 - Open the CMPT432Neumann-master.zip file
In that file, you will find a folder called Design Compiler and a file named DesignCompiler.xcodeproj

## Step 4 - Double click the DesignCompiler.xcodeproj
This will open the project at it's current state in Xcode.

## Step 5 - Click the Play(â–¶) button located in the top left.
This will process the code and open the application.

### Extra - Checking the code
If you would like to view the code, either open the ViewController.swift file in xCode, or navigate to the DesignCompiler folder previously mentioned and you will find ViewController.swift.
